# Typed clients

A workflow calls the connector through Nexus by naming a service, an operation, and an input. You
can build that input by hand as JSON, but a typed client is easier: your editor knows the fields,
and a bad request fails in your code, with the field named, before it is sent.

## The contract

The connector's operations are defined in one file, [`http.nexusrpc.yaml`](../http.nexusrpc.yaml),
its *contract*. It names the service (`HTTPService`), its operation (`sendRequest`), and the input
and output types as JSON Schema. It is the source of truth for what a request may contain; the
connector rejects anything it doesn't allow.

## nexgen

[nexgen](https://github.com/temporalio/nexgen) is a code generator from Temporal. Given a contract,
it writes, for one language:

- the input and output types, which check the contract when they are encoded and decoded, and
- a service definition you pass to that language's Nexus client.

It doesn't write the call itself; you still use your Temporal SDK's Nexus client, as in
[Usage](usage.md).

## Go

Go types are already generated and committed in this repo, in `generated/httpapi`. Import them:

```go
import "github.com/temporalio/nexus-connector-http/generated/httpapi"
```

[Usage](usage.md#call-from-a-go-workflow) shows a complete call.

## Other languages

Download nexgen 0.2.9, the version this repo pins (macOS on Apple silicon shown; the release also
has `x86_64-apple-darwin`, `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`, and `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`):

```bash
curl --silent --show-error --fail --location \
  https://github.com/temporalio/nexgen/releases/download/v0.2.9/nexgen-v0.2.9-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz \
  | tar --extract --gzip nexgen
```

Then, from your project, with a copy of `http.nexusrpc.yaml`:

```bash
./nexgen python     http.nexusrpc.yaml --output httpapi
./nexgen typescript http.nexusrpc.yaml --output httpapi
./nexgen java       http.nexusrpc.yaml --output src/main/java/com/example/httpapi --package-name com.example.httpapi
```

For Java, the last part of `--package-name` must match the output folder's name.

To see what each language produces without setting up a project, run `make clients` in this repo.
It generates all four into `.build/clients/<language>`, which is not committed.

## Without a generated client

Any Nexus client can send the input as plain JSON. The fields are listed in
[Usage: Options](usage.md#options). A request that breaks the contract is rejected with a
`BAD_REQUEST` handler error, which doesn't name the failing field; see [Errors](errors.md).

## When the contract changes

Regenerate your client from the new `http.nexusrpc.yaml`. The service and operation names on the
wire are pinned in the contract, so a regenerated client keeps reaching the same operation.
